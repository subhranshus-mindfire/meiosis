# meiosis

**Source control where a green check expires.**

Evidence is bound to the exact state of the code it was produced against. When
that code changes, the proof goes stale on its own — no re-run required to find
out it no longer applies.

        test-run passed against world 615807ff
        HEAD is now world 32bd0271, and the footprint moved:

          ~ internal/auth/token.go        3 commits ago  (int_9f2a)
          ~ internal/auth/session.go      3 commits ago  (int_9f2a)

        this change has never been verified against the code it now runs on
```

Every CI system in use today produces green checks that quietly stop meaning
anything the moment someone else merges. Nobody notices, because the check is
attached to a branch name rather than to a tree.

meiosis attaches it to a content hash.

## Why this exists

The reviewable unit is wrong.

A diff is a record of edits, not a claim about behaviour. That was tolerable
when a human wrote every line and another human read them. It stops working
when most changes are produced by agents, because three things break at once:

- **Review attention.** Humans cannot read a thousand diffs a day, and reading
  faster is not the fix.
- **Semantic conflicts.** Two changes merge cleanly and are broken together.
  Git sees no conflict. Nobody does, until production.
- **The cost of proof.** Re-running full CI on every rebase of every branch
  stops being economically possible somewhere around agent number fifty.

None of those are Git's fault. Git tracks changes to files extremely well, and
it carries the Linux kernel without complaining. The gap is above Git: nothing
records what a change was *trying* to do, what evidence supports it, who or
what produced it, or whether that evidence still holds.

So the unit of change moves:

```
   from   commit → diff → PR
     to   intent → implementation → evidence → evaluation → merge
```

## The core idea

Three properties, and they only work together:

**Evidence expires.** Every verification result — test run, type check, security
scan, human review — is bound to the 32-byte hash of the tree it was produced
against, plus the set of paths it depends on. When any of them changes, the
record becomes stale automatically. Merged changes carry a live status:
`verified`, `stale`, or `unverified`.

**Evidence must be independent.** If the agent wrote the code and also wrote the
test that proves the code, that is self-graded homework. Every evidence record
names its producer, and policy can require that the producer is not the author.
This is enforced, not advisory.

**Agents are cryptographic principals.** Not a bot account with a shared token.
Each agent holds a keypair and a capability scoped by path, operation, spend and
TTL — and can only delegate a *strict subset* of its own scope to agents it
spawns. Every write traces back through the delegation chain to an originating
human.

## What it looks like in use

Scope is declared up front and enforced when the write happens, not discovered
in review:

```
$ mei work submit

  rejected — write outside declared scope

    intent int_9f2a  "add rate limiting to the auth middleware"
    allow            internal/auth/**, internal/middleware/**

    ~ internal/billing/invoice.go        not in scope
```

And every merge decision is derivable:

```
$ mei why 1de9

  decision   merge          .meiosis/policy/default.rego @ 7c1a9e
  risk       blast_radius=12  sensitive_paths=[]

  evidence
    ✓ test-run       pass   independent   fresh
    ✓ type-check     pass   independent   fresh
    ✓ replay-match   pass   independent   fresh    zygote bundle 3f9c
    · human-review          not required by policy at this risk level

  provenance
    agent:impl-3   claude-opus-5   delegated from human:lakin
    prompt 8a2f11…   1.2M tok in / 41k out   $2.14
```

## How it works

meiosis sits above Git storage and below your agent runtime. It replaces
neither.

```
   humans (CLI, web UI)        agents (MCP, gRPC)
            │                          │
            ▼                          ▼
   ┌───────────────────────────────────────────────┐
   │                 meiosis server                │
   │  intent · attempt · evidence · policy · merge │
   ├───────────────────────────────────────────────┤
   │  git wire protocol  │  content-addressed vfs  │
   └───────────────────────────────────────────────┘
            │                          │
      existing git tooling      evidence producers
      (clone / push / CI / IDE)  (CI, linters, replay)
```

`git clone`, `git push`, your editor, and your existing CI all work unchanged.
The Git remote is a complete escape hatch: a plain clone gives you every byte of
history with no dependency on meiosis. That is deliberate — anti-lock-in is a
feature, not an accident.

Agents reach the same functionality over **MCP**, served from the same binary.
No bindings to write.

## Status

**Design stage. There is no working binary yet.**

The [format specification](spec/v1/README.md) and requirements are written and reviewable; implementation
starts at M0. If you are here to try it, come back after M1 — that is the first
milestone that does anything useful. If you are here to argue with the design,
now is exactly the right time.

| | | |
|---|---|---|
| **M0** | in progress | object model, canonical encoding, signing, Git wire serving, storage |
| **M1** | next | intent, scope enforcement, evidence ingest, capabilities, MCP, CLI |
| **M2** | | footprints, automatic invalidation, verified/stale status, policy gate |
| **M3** | | speculative merge queue, incremental re-verification, semantic conflicts |
| **M4** | | continuous re-validation, outcome linking, calibration |

Full detail in [`docs/SRS.md`](docs/SRS.md), including numbered requirements,
measurable targets, and the open decisions that are still open.

## What this is not

Stated plainly, so nobody is surprised later:

- **Not a Git replacement.** Git is the storage and the escape hatch.
- **Not a CI system.** meiosis orchestrates and records evidence. It executes
  nothing.
- **Not an agent framework.** Any agent, any language, any model.
- **Not cloud-dependent.** No telemetry, no license check, no model API. Runs
  fully air-gapped, and there is a CI test that proves it.
- **Not a complete semantic conflict detector.** v1 detects exported-signature
  changes intersected with the reverse-dependency graph. That catches a useful
  fraction and misses plenty. Behavioural equivalence checking is a research
  problem and we will not pretend otherwise.

## Self-hosting

One static binary. No cgo, no Kubernetes, no external services.

```sh
# planned — not yet functional
mei serve
```

SQLite and the local filesystem by default. Postgres and any S3-compatible
store when you outgrow one node. Backup is a copy of the data directory.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome, and design criticism is worth more than code right
now.

- **Apache-2.0**, chosen for the patent grant.
- **DCO sign-off** (`git commit -s`). No CLA — contributor volume is worth more
  to this project than the option to relicense.
- **Conventional Commits:** We strictly enforce conventional commits via local Git hooks. Run `./scripts/install-hooks.sh` immediately after cloning.
- The format specification in [`spec/v1`](spec/v1/README.md) is versioned independently of the
  server and has its own compatibility policy. The server is the reference
  implementation; the spec is the thing we hope outlives it.
- A language-agnostic conformance suite lives in `spec/conformance/` so other
  implementations are possible.

See [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md). Issues tagged `good first issue` are
real ones, not busywork.

Versioning is honest: `v0.x`, and **the object format will break before v1.0.**

## Why "meiosis"

Cells divide two ways, and the difference is the argument for this project.

**Mitosis** produces two genetically identical copies. It is duplication — fast,
faithful, unremarkable. That is `git branch`: a perfect copy of a tree, where the
only correctness question is whether the copy is exact.

**Meiosis** is the other one, and it is doing something considerably harder. One
cell produces four gametes, none identical to the parent or to each other. Along
the way it performs three operations mitosis has no equivalent for:

**Recombination.** Homologous chromosomes physically pair and exchange segments.
This is a genuine merge of two lineages, not one overlaid on the other. A
textual three-way merge is closer to overlay.

**Variation under selection.** Independent assortment alone yields 2²³
combinations in humans. Meiosis deliberately generates a population of candidates
and lets selection resolve them — which is how this system treats change: several
attempts at one declared intent, ranked by evidence, one merged, the rest kept
with their evidence intact.

**Checkpoints that arrest.** This is the part that names the project. Meiosis
will not proceed through an unverified state. The pachytene checkpoint halts the
cell until homologs have correctly synapsed and recombination intermediates are
resolved; the spindle checkpoint blocks separation until every chromosome is
properly attached. Failure means arrest, not a warning logged somewhere.
Verification is not a stage appended to division — it is a precondition the
machinery cannot bypass.

And the timing is the last argument. Prophase I — pairing, checking, recombining
— is by far the longest phase; in human oocytes it lasts decades, while the
division itself takes hours. Almost all of the cost is in establishing that the
exchange is sound. Almost none of it is in the exchange.

That is the correct ratio for software written by machines and governed by
humans. The change is cheap. The proof is the work.

Pronounced *my-OH-sis*. The CLI is `mei`.
